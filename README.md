#  PokemonGO - Customer Analytics project

The academic project was to provide CRM recommendations to Niantic based on simluated user data from their Augmented Reality game Pok√©monGo.  

From understanding playing and purchasing patterns to the development of a churn predictive model, we dive into data exploration, data preparation and data modelling of player-related, microtransactions and playing sessions datasets.

Contents of the repo : 
- `Pokemon_Go_Case_Final_Script.R` : final R script outputing all insights from the project workflow
- `Summary_Report.pdf` : detailed report presenting the whole data sience pipeline of the project 
- `Recommendations_to_Niantic.pdf` presentation delivered to Niantic exposing the top patterns and CRM recommendations found
